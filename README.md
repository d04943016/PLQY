Ref. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.19970090308 

The core code is in PLQY.py and the calculation is based on the numpy and scipy.

Besides, there are three different types of graphic user interface (GUI) including tkinter (unfinished), PyQt5, and streamlit 
so if you would like to use the GUI, please install PyQt5 or streamlit.
